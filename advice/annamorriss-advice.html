			<h4>You can do this!</h4>
			<p>When you start coding it can feel like an alien language and you can wonder how you are ever going to learn to code. but little by little day by day you get the hang of it and before you know it you are creating your first web page.</p>

			<p>Stick at it, you will make lots of mistakes at first, but that is how you learn ad a big part of the process. Trial and error is your new best friend.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="advice-right">
			<h4>Where to start.</h4>
			<p>Start by learning the basics of html and css and you will be well on your way. Coding is all about practice. practice until it becomes second nature. I thought at first I would never learn, I worried I was too old, too right brain in nature. I worried that I would never remember everything. But hey look at me now, I am coding</p>

			<p>If I can do it, then anyone can do it, so just make a start and you will not regret it.</p>
